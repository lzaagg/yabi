ant defaults to just generating a jarfile
this jarfile can be placed in a deploy of Axis
then the deploy scripts must be modified to look for the path of the chosen Axis deploy
then the deploy scripts can be run

or instead of using deploy scripts, the axis server config file can be modified and the axis webapp 
redeployed.
