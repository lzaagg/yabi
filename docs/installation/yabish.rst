Setting up Yabish
-----------------

Note: If you chose to run fab quickstart in one command (fab quickstart)
you can skip this step, as fab quickstart will set up Yabish as well.

If you would like to use yabish (the commad line interface to YABI) or
you want to run the automated end to end test suite that uses Yabish,
you will have to bootstrap it:

    $ fab yabish_bootstrap
