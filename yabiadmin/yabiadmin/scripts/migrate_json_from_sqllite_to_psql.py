# Migrates the json and the Tags of a Workflow from SQLLite to Postgres.
# SQLLite files should be moved out of the way after the migration finished,
# the new DB files will be created automatically.
# To run start up a shell_plus and call into migrate():
#
# yabiadmin $ fab manage:shell_plus
# shell> from scripts import migrate_json_from_sqllite_to_psql as m
#
# To make a simulation only do (now True by default):
#
# shell> m.DontAct = True
#
# shell> m.migrate(USERNAME)
#
# or to migrate all users call without args:
#
# shell> m.migrate()
#
# If you want to do the migration for real set back DontAct to False first
#
# shell> m.DontAct = False
